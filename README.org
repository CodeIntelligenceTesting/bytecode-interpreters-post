A few basic bytecode interpreters used as example code in an article (see =interpreter-p1.org=). Given
a recent GCC all the interpreters can be compiled in one go using a supplied Makefile:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make all
make test
#+END_SRC

Examples contain:

1. A trival switch interpreter.
2. Immediate operand instruction example.
3. A stack vm.
4. A register vm.
5. A regular expression matching machine.
